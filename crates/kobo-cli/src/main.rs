Cobalt
======

Everything is on the same partition your books are on and is visible from any
computer over USB. The managed payload is in this folder; its stable launch
entrypoint is the sibling .adds/cobalt-launch.sh.

For a safe complete removal, run `kobo setup --undo`. It removes the managed
cobalt/current, next, and previous trees, .adds/cobalt-launch.sh, and only the
exact Cobalt entry from .adds/nm/cobalt or .adds/nm/menu. Owner folders are
moved to .adds/cobalt.recovery.N first. Inspect those directories and any
.adds/cobalt.unusable[.N] quarantine before deleting recoverable data.
Nothing was written to the system partition and no startup script was added.

To start it: run .adds/cobalt-launch.sh. If you have NickelMenu installed, add
this one line to .adds/nm/menu to get an entry in the reader's own menu:

  menu_item :main    :Cobalt    :cmd_spawn    :quiet:/mnt/onboard/.adds/cobalt-launch.sh

Starting Cobalt stops the stock reader for the length of the session and
starts it again afterwards. That takes twenty to thirty seconds each way. A
reboot always returns you to the stock reader.

const INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "\
To install on a device:
  1. Charge it. The reader refuses to install anything on a low battery, and
     it does so silently.
  2. Connect it by USB and copy this file to .kobo/KoboRoot.tgz on the drive
     that appears.
  3. Eject the drive. The device installs it at the next boot and restarts.

Everything lands in .adds/cobalt plus the stable .adds/cobalt-launch.sh on the
same drive. Use `kobo setup --undo` for a complete safe uninstall: it also
removes the exact Cobalt NickelMenu entry and preserves owner folders under
.adds/cobalt.recovery.N. Inspect recovery and .adds/cobalt.unusable[.N]
directories before deleting them. Nothing is written to the system partition.";
